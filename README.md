# GCC WebApp Dashboard 
<h2>Web App code files from World Bank</h2>

<h1>Data Source</h1>
Retrieved data of the GDP and the GDP per capita for the GCC countries and to be compared to Spain.
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD


<h1>Idea behind the Dashboard</h1>
To show case that Spain’s economy is the one of the smallest in the EU and all the GCC economies combined are just barely as big as Spain’s economy. Another point to contemplate is that even though Spain’s GDP is multiples of the GCCs but the GDP per capita for Spaniards is much lower than the average GDP per capita of GCC citizens.
